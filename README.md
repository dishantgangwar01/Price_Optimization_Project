# Price_Optimization_Project
# ðŸ“ˆ Price Optimization Analysis using Python

This project focuses on developing a **dynamic pricing model** to optimize item prices at a retail store for maximum revenue while staying competitive in the market.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset contains pricing and sales information for items sold at a retail store, along with competitor pricing. The data spans multiple fiscal weeks and covers various item categories. The columns included are:

- **Fiscal_Week_Id**: Identifier for the fiscal week.
- **Store_Id**: Identifier for the store.
- **Item_Id**: Identifier for the item.
- **Price**: Selling price of the item at our store.
- **Item_Quantity**: Quantity of the item sold.
- **Sales_Amount_No_Discount**: Sales revenue before applying discounts.
- **Sales_Amount**: Sales revenue after applying discounts.
- **Competition_Price**: Competitor's price for the same item.

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement

The objective is to create a **dynamic pricing model** that:

- Analyzes the existing pricing strategy and its effect on sales and revenue.
- Compares in-store prices with competitor prices to spot pricing inefficiencies and opportunities.
- Leverages market trends, competitor data, and demand elasticity to dynamically adjust item prices.
- Simulates and evaluates the performance of the dynamic pricing model against the current static pricing strategy.

## ðŸ§  Goals

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the pricing landscape.
- Calculate **price elasticity of demand** for different items.
- Analyze **sales trends** across fiscal weeks and item categories.
- Use **machine learning** or **optimization techniques** to create a dynamic pricing engine.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s impact on revenue and competitiveness.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook


## ðŸ“… Future Work

- Integrate real-time competitor pricing for automated re-pricing.
- Extend the model to include seasonal trends and promotional effects.
- Deploy the model in a retail environment using a pricing API.
